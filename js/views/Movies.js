//TODO: We need to set up a 'card' that has the following

// Title
// Genre
// Rating
// Director

//Plot. But Plot is a STRETCH GOAL. Lets just worry about the first 4.

// To get all movies made, we'll for loop through and each movie object into a card, then print them all to the DOM
// Don't forget, each card needs a delete button attached to it!
export default function MoviesView(props) {

}


//Each movie needs a delete button attached to it, that will target by ID.
// Set up an event onclick, to send out a DELETE request.
export function MoviesEvents() {
